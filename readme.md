# Refugee DeClassified

This is another variant of the Refugee / Fusion AmpDeck skin, this time based off of Eris's DeClassified skin. :)

Includes a few features differing from DeClassified such as:
	- Custom made Speakers made to replicate the old speaker plugin Fusion AmpDeck used to come with.
	- Separated Playlist and Main window Visualizers. Just cuz I thought it'd be neat. :)
